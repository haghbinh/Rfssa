\title{Load Jambi MODIS Data from GitHub Repository}
\format{
A list containing two arrays, each with dimensions 33 by 33 by 448. One array represents NDVI
image data, and the other represents EVI image data. The list also contains a date vector of length 448,
specifying the date of capture for each 33 by 33 image.

\description{
This function is used to load the Jambi dataset from a GitHub repository hosted at
https://github.com/haghbinh/dataset/Rfssa_dataset. By hosting datasets on GitHub
instead of including them in the Rfssa R package, it saves a significant amount of space.
The Jambi dataset contains normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation
index (EVI) image data from NASAâ€™s MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with
global coverage at 250 m^2 resolution. The dataset covers the Jambi Province, Indonesia,
which is known for various forested land utilizations, including natural forests and plantations.
Monitoring such land cover changes is essential, especially in the context of forest exploitation and
conservation efforts. Seasonal variations play a significant role in long-term land cover changes.
}
\details{
The data collection started on February 18, 2000, and continued until July 28, 2019, with data recorded
every 16 days. This dataset is valuable for studying vegetative land cover changes in the region.
