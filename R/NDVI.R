#' Jambi NDVI Density Function Data
#'
#' This data set is Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI, from NASAâ€™s MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with global coverage at 250 m^2.
#' The study was located in Jambi Province, Indonesia.
#' Indonesia manages various forested land utilizations, for instance natural forest and plantations.
#' In the past, natural forest had been exploited throughout the country.
#' Greater criticisms on forest exploitation lead to a moratorium which needs to be
#' monitored frequently.Assessment of woody vegetation could be taken using field surveys or
#' remote sensing. Season is probably the most intriguing factor in vegetative land cover,
#' especially in long-term land cover changes (Lambin, 1999).
#' The data was gathered starting in 2000-01-01 and ending in 2019-05-12 every 16 days.
#' Therefore, the original dataset includes 441 NDVI images of size 33*33 pixels. Kernel desnity estimation was performed on this data to obtain 441 NDVI densities that give the distribution of pixel intensity in each image.
